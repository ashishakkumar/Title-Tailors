## Enchanting Overview

## Magical Mission
In a cosmos brimming with over sixteen million astronomy papers, our enchantment lies in crafting titles that captivate yet remain true to their scientific roots. Our goal is to elevate the presence of these scholarly works in the celestial archives of NASA/ADS.

## The Alchemy of Data
Our cauldron simmers with data from the NASA/ADS astronomy paper database, a treasure trove of titles, abstracts, and scholarly metrics. We're concocting a potion that filters this data through mystical metrics, ensuring each paper's title sparkles in the academic firmament.

## The Enchantment Lab
In our lab, magic and science blend seamlessly:
- Summarizing astronomical papers through the art of large language models.
- Creating a web portal where researchers can witness the metamorphosis of their paper titles.
- Focusing on efficient sorcery, harnessing the power of CPU-based inference for our spells.

## Taming the Magical Beasts (Models)
In the heart of our lab reside our magical beasts â€“ grand models that are more than mere algorithms. They are creatures of deep learning and wonder, each needing to be tamed and taught to understand the essence of academic titles. As we master their abilities, they evolve, becoming ever more adept at illuminating the true nature of scholarly works.

## A Continuous Journey of Mystical Discovery
The realm of Title Tailors is in constant flux, alive with the promise of new enchantments and methodologies. We are diligently working to harness these spells and share our journey's updates in this tome of unfolding mysteries.
